# Project E-Commerce: Product Range Analysis

### Overview

We will analyse an ecommerce website Gift Store to evaluate the product catalog. Our goal is to identify the best-selling products and determine the focus areas for future marketing efforts. Additionally, we'll ensure that the online product listings align with the offline inventory, and all items on the website are in stock and available for customers.

### Project Objective:

<b>The objective of this project is to boost the shopâ€™s revenue by identifying the most popular products and product bundles, as well as the least popular products.</b>

### Analysis Scope

1) Preprocessing: We will assess the dataset, investigate each column and determine what needs fixing and cleaning.

2) Categorisation: We will categorise our product description into smaller categories. We will need to use a lemmetization function in order to assess keywords and then determine which categories are our best sellers.

3) Exploration: We'll explore the monthly sales revenue, new and returning customers as well as trying to determine the lifetime value.

4) Statistical tests: After the exploration we will use statistical tests in order to test our hypothesis.

5) Conclusion and Recommendation: We'll write our client some business recommendations to improve their revenue.
